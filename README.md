# Periods are red, violets are blue..

## Inspiration

I was quite stuck as a mind-numbingly-uncreative-human-being to find an idea for this project. I first thought, maybe a budget tracking app. My finances are always a mess and I think I can benefit from it myself. But then, cue in my period (too much information, apologies). While I was logging my period details in Clue (a period tracking application that I use and have taken some inspiration from as well), the first thing that popped up was their subscription advertisement and for some unknown reason (periods), it frustrated me to no end. I have already searched high and low for a good period tracking app where my data is safe, there aren't too many ads, it has the functions that I am looking for and I am certain I am not the only one who has gone through this journey. A manual calendar, while safe, doesn't have any other advantages to it. And then the idea struck me like lightening. Why don't I make a **period tracking app**? A very basic, no cost, period tracking app that I can use and hopefully others can benefit from as well. It will have no advertisements and no hidden functionalities that you can only use if you subscribe. 

## Potential functionality

User is asked to log at least *three past periods' information* for the app to be able to analyze their data and from there on, they can log an entry every day if they like. They can enter their period information, including but not limited to, bleeding, collection method (pads, tampons, etc.), pain level(s)/area(s) and how they are feeling. They can also analyze this data such as what their average cycle looks like, how many pads/tampons/other collection methods did they use and also check their previous entries.  

Women's health has always been extremely important to me, especially breast health so I will include an extra function where users can log any changes to their **breast health** along with their period information. Many women experience breast changes such as swelling, nipple discharge, painful breasts at some point or another in their cycle. Most period tracking applications do not have this functionality (as far as I can remember) and it can lead to unnecessary worrying and visits to physicians. While Clue has recently added this to their application, it can only be used with their subscription.

## Target Audience

- I will develop this app with women and other female-oriented genders in mind.
